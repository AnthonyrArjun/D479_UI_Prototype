  2) To publish online quickly:
     - GitHub Pages: create a new repo, push these files to the repo root or 'gh-pages' branch and enable GitHub Pages.
     - Netlify: drag-and-drop the unzipped folder to Netlify's site deploy area.
     - Vercel: connect repo or use 'vercel' CLI to deploy the folder.
